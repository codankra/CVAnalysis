# CVAnalysis 

### Working with cvlibs images to compare properties of submitted algorithms.

Currently, `hello.py` takes in two error disparity maps (see [CVdata](https://github.com/codankra/CVdata) for example images) and computes the correlation coefficient between the two selected algorithms' errors.
